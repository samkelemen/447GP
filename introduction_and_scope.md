# Introduction & Scope

## Project Overview
The purpose behind the DB is to provide a service to libraries that allows them to manage everyday tasks such as member tracking, book tracking, and reports. This should allow libraries to efficiently complete tasks and bring overall improvement to their business by streamlining common jobs. 

## Scope
The DB will specifically be able to handle tasks such as finding books based on specific attributes (e.g., author name, publication year, or availability status), tracking member information, monitoring statistical data like borrowing data, popularity data. It will also allow them to manage fines/fees and generate reports.
