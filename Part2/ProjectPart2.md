# Introduction

## Project Overview
Purpose of DB and intended use. 
The purpose of the database The Librarians are working on building is a database that makes use of storing library property, track members, member activity, fines/fees, and much more. This makes our database system suited for libraries to be able to handle most tasks for organizational purposes including report generation. 


## Scope
Define boundaries of project (what will/won't be covered)
The project will be implementing the ability to manage books and digital material with appropriate attributes that are common of all expected literatures as well as its availability. Clients will be tracked in the system in terms of unique ID, memberships, and their activity with library property. This includes transactions and time stamps which all will be included in the report. 

What the project will not cover is sophisticated UI, recommendation systems, external integrations, or complex permission systems. The Librarians are not in charge of developing these systems as we expect only appointed staff and users to be able to manage these systems under the authority of those in charge of the library or business. The goal is to have a simple readable and usable system without the complexity of creating a distracting UI or system as the focus is accuracy and efficiency.

## Glossary
Include glossary of terms or acronyms (if any) used in the document
Entries below are defined as (Term) -> (Definition).

The Librarians  ->  The alias used by the team developing library database system.
DB              ->  An acronym for database. 

# Stakeholders  
The following numbered sections define who is the target audience for the database system (in no particular order).

1. End-Users  
  &nbsp; Employees - Individuals who are appointed by the owner or manager of the library or business to interact with the database. May also be described as internal users. 

2. Database Administrators  
 &nbsp; This may be anyone with experience in database management system that may be contracted by the library or business to manage a copy of the DB management system developed by The Librarians.

3. Library/Business Executives   
  &nbsp; This is anyone of an executive position in the business or library that may want to access information or data in the DB in order to make any decisions or changes to their system.

# Requirements

## Functional Requirements 

{{{{Delete this later: Functional Requirements: Specify the essential functions the database must perform. These functions can include user administration, data entry, retrieval, updates, deletions, and report generation. For report generation, refer to the sample queries/reports provided at the end of the project description for ideas. Additionally, as a team, brainstorm and propose other types of queries/reports that might be of interest to users. Data Entities: List and describe the main data entities and their attributes and their data types or constraints. Note: these should represent major entities and their attributes (see the project description as the starting point); the list may be expanded upon when you develop the conceptual model.

Optional: Non-Functional Requirements: Include performance metrics, security requirements, and any other constraints like compliance with regulations. You will not be expected to show that the non-functional properties hold. }}}}

# Hardware and Software Requirements 
The hardware the team plans to use is the EECS cycle servers at The University of Kansas Campus. As for the software that the team plans to use is MariaDB on the servers mentioned earlier.
