# Introduction

## Project Overview
Purpose of DB and intended use. 
The purpose of the database The Librarians are working on building is a database that makes use of storing library property, track members, member activity, fines/fees, and much more. This makes our database system suited for libraries to be able to handle most tasks for organizational purposes including report generation. 


## Scope
Define boundaries of project (what will/won't be covered)
The project will be implementing the ability to manage books and digital material with appropriate attributes that are common of all expected literatures as well as its availability. Clients will be tracked in the system in terms of unique ID, memberships, and their activity with library property. This includes transactions and time stamps which all will be included in the report. 

What the project will not cover is sophisticated UI, recommendation systems, external integrations, or complex permission systems. The Librarians are not in charge of developing these systems as we expect only appointed staff and users to be able to manage these systems under the authority of those in charge of the library or business. The goal is to have a simple readable and usable system without the complexity of creating a distracting UI or system as the focus is accuracy and efficiency.
