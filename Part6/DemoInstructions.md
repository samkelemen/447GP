FROM Book AS b
WHERE YEAR(b.PublicationDate) = 2023;
```

# Check membership status for a specific client
```SQL
-- Replace 'ClientID' with the desired client ID
SELECT c.ClientID,
       c.Name,

# Never-late clients
```SQL
-- This selects clients who have never had an overdue transaction (either currently overdue or at the time of return, depending on how you'd track late returns).
SELECT 
  c.ClientID,
  c.Name
FROM Client AS c
WHERE NOT EXISTS (
  SELECT 1
  FROM `Transaction` AS t
  WHERE t.ClientID = c.ClientID
    AND t.ReturnDate IS NULL
    AND t.DueDate < CURDATE()
);
```

# Frequent borrowers of a specific genre
```SQL
-- This query counts how many times each client has borrowed a book of a specific genre. You can change 'Fantasy' to any genre you want to analyze.
SELECT 
  c.ClientID,
  c.Name,
  COUNT(*) AS TimesBorrowed
FROM `Transaction` AS t
JOIN Client AS c ON t.ClientID = c.ClientID
JOIN Book AS b ON t.ItemID = b.ItemID
WHERE b.Genre = 'Fantasy'

## Reports:

Below we have provided two report queries for our database. These reports have a description of what it does followed by the code to run

# Detect books with zero borrows
SELECT
  b.ItemID,
  b.Title,
  b.ISBN,
  b.PublicationDate
FROM
  Book AS b
LEFT JOIN
  `Transaction` AS t
  ON b.ItemID = t.ItemID
WHERE
  t.TransactionID IS NULL;

# Calculate average book age

-- 2. Calculate average book age (in years, to two decimal places)
SELECT
  ROUND(
    AVG(
      DATEDIFF(CURDATE(), PublicationDate) / 365.0
    ),
    2
  ) AS AverageBookAgeYears
FROM
  Book;
