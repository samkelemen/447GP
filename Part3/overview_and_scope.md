# Introduction

## Project Overview
The purpose behind the DB is to provide a service for libraries to be able to manage everyday tasks such as member tracking, book tracking, and reports for example. This should allow for libraries to efficiently complete tasks and bring overall improvement.

## Scope
The DB will specifically handle tasks such as finding books based on a specific attribute (e.g., author name, publication year, or availability status), tracking member information, monitoring borrowing/popularity data and statistics, managing fines/fees, and generating reports. This DB is meant to maintain accuracy across these essential library functions.
